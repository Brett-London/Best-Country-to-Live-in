# Best Country to Live In
- 📝Data from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rafsunahmad/best-country-to-live-in-2024
- Data pulled into Tableau.
- Data contains information about each countrys population size, land mass in KM, whether the country is A UN member, bordering countries, population growth rate, countries region, world happiness rating (2022), Human Development Index ranking 2020 and 2021, population density in KM and MI.  
- 📊Created many differnt visuals to examine the data to determine the best country to live in. Maps and bar charts were the main data visulizations created.
- Caluctated field crated to combine the HDI grade from 2020/2021 to create an AVG. 
- 🤔My opinion of which country would be the best to live in, determined from the data would be Iceland. A common trend is for Nordic countries such as Iceland to rank high both in human development index and world happiness rating. Iceland ranked number 3 in both categories showing consistency. Norway ranked number 1 in HDI but fell to number 8 in World happiness rating, therfore the consistency showed by Iceland earned them the number 1 spot. Unlike some European countires that rank high in both of these grading systems that show poor population growth which should be taken in consideration when deciding, Iceland still shows a + level of population growth. If Land mass and population size are the deciding factors for the best country to live in, then these Nordic counties would not be the most desrible countires to live in.
